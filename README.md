> ### Hello! 
> #### I am a current sophomore at Loyola University Chicago studying Software Engineering with career interests in Data Analysts and Software Development. 


#### Leadership roles: 
  * Minorities In Tech (_Marketing Director_)
  
  * Software and Systems Laboratory (_Research Assistant_)
 
  * GirlForward (_Tutor_)

##### I strive to gain experience, expand my network to best determine where I fit best in my interests and become involved in community based work. 

  Software Engineering stood out substantially as I enjoy creativity, assembling and the marketing aspect of this career. It also provides flexibilty, oppurtunities and imagination.

  It may be challenging but when it comes to coding with the dedication anyone can learn!
