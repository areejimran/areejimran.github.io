> ##### I am a current sophomore at Loyola University Chicago studying Software Engineering with career interests in Data Analysts and Software Development. 


##### I was born in the Netherlands and raised in Chicago, IL. The acceleration and rise of data and technology through out my childhood has encouraged me to be apart of these great innovations that continue to happen on a day to day basis. 

* #### Leadership roles: 
  * Minorities In Tech (_Marketing Director_)

  I strive to gain experience, expand my network to best determine where I fit best in my interests and become involved in community based work. 

  Software Engineering stood out substantially as I enjoy creativity, assembling and the marketing aspect of this career. It also provides flexibilty, oppurtunities and imagination.

  It may be challenging but when it comes to coding with the dedication anyone can learn!
